# pgAsync - Asynchronous PostgreSQL Java driver

This module is derived from the [pgAsync](https://github.com/marat-gainullin/postgres-async-driver) project.
At this point it is mostly left as is, but the goal is to heavily refactor it to make it a better fit into Pragmatic Lite functional style API.
